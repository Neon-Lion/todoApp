# To_Do_App_Project
This is to do app project using JavaScript with Fetch API.
# By doing this project I learned:

- how to use the [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) which provides a more powerful and flexible feature set than [XMLHttpRequest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest)
